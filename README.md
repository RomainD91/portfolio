#### Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

[Github Code](https://github.com/RomainD91/Project-ML-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git)

Development of a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using Python. This project includes data analysis and fundamental applications of preprocessing and modeling techniques. It addresses class imbalance and performs feature engineering to enhance model accuracy. The result is a high recall (0.8-0.9), effectively identifying customers likely to churn. In conclusion, recommendations are made to improve model accuracy, strengthen customer retention, overall satisfaction, and long-term loyalty.

#### Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

[Github Code](https://github.com/RomainD91/Project-EDA-Uber-supply-demand.git)

Developed a data analysis project to identify causes of Uber driver cancellations and car unavailability during trips to the airport. This project included time series analysis, data visualization, and advanced analytics. Key observations highlighted significant supply-demand gaps during morning and evening rush hours. This led to recommendations such as dynamic pricing, improved driver communication, and predictive analytics. These measures aim to improve service availability, customer satisfaction, and better understand underlying issues.
